Python program to generate trigger matrix from roads...
Also some pattern generations

1) To conver RS to VHDL file:

python3 road2vhdl.py 460 or python3 road2vhdl.py 470 

copy vhdl files to the proper FPGA design and compile:

2) To conver RS to text file (you have to change "rs_directory"  parameter in the python file):

python3 road2text.py  

File will generate 4 files: rs_LB_neg_bot.txt rs_LB_neg_top.txt rs_LB_pos_bot.txt rs_LB_pos_top.txt
in the "rs_directory/mapping" directory. THis files needs to be copied to the online monitoring system: 

/data2/e1039/resource/trigger/rs/rs***, where *** is the specific roadset, for example 135.
